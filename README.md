# Rock-paper-scissor-ver-1
This is the version I made while I was familrizing myself with javascript. I used a base version   to create this version of the game.
the game uses alert & if else algorithm to finish the game.

By making this version I familirized myself with basic algorithm generation and basic functionality of the html.

I plan to make the game more interactive with javascript in the upcoming versions.
